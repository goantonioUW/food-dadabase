  ## User Story
  AS A user, I want to be able to look up recipies and be able to save my favorites for later and have a laugh while doing so. 

  I WANT to be able to create a shopping list of ingredients that I need for the recipe. 

  SO THAT I can easily find something new or an old favorite and create a grocery list for the ingredients that I will need.
